# ChatGPT_GammaSandbox
A consilience of interdisciplinary scripts in finance, data science, and mathematics that attempt to harness the power of computational neural networks and other machine learning tools.

This repository aims to serve as a centralized space for the following 3 main concepts subject to semantic analysis implemented by a series of tools. These tools may vary from simple statistics based methods to more nuanced physics models that aim to incorporate into modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Examples of these are evolutionary computation, adversarial neural networks and finally, using ChatGPT to help out in making sense of all of this.

The main directory structure is as follows:

### /jupyter_notebooks - main sandbox space for testing out new scripts.

   ### - /financialanalysistools - dataframes/charts for option and stock analysis.
      
   ### - /crimeprediction_publicsafety - machine learning predictive critical event algorithms.
      
   ### - /administrative_task_automation - vba, python task automation for saving time.

The above folders are initial starting points, other subdirectories that will most likely emerge will be input/output paths.
